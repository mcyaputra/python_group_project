New Aussie music platform aims to help creatives make money from their work,9News,2024-05-22 11:55:30,"A Perth tech company is working to revolutionise the music industry with a platform it hopes will give Spotify a run for its money. MyPremo, which has the backing of global rap star Ice Cube, helps artists better monetise their work. Sebastian Jamze dreams of being a full-time musician. READ MORE: Relief after bodybuilder who murdered mum in front of her children jailed The 19 year-old's career took off after winning a reality TV singing competition. But he says the income from his music isn't sustainable, as streaming giants like Spotify take most of the revenue from his work. ""You're putting so much of your heart and soul into your song, mixing, mastering. You're putting so much money into your music, and then you're not getting anything back from what you've made,"" Jamze said. And he's not alone - many say the industry is broken. A Perth company now hoping to change the game and save the music industry. Cody McDowell and co-founder James Gillies have started website - MyPremo - a subscription free service - where musicians can sell their work directly to fans. READ MORE: What is clear-air turbulence and can pilots avoid it?﻿ MyPremo aims to put the power back into creators' hands, allowing them to have control of their content and revenue. ""A lot of musicians aren't making money, it's very publicly known, from the Snoop Doggs of the world telling everyone they are making $45,000 from a billion streams to the small local artists who are on the pub circuit making no money,"" McDowell said. ""We're trying to throw a lifeline out to Australian artists and help give them some money to put food on the table."" Creators release their songs, and set their own price per play, receiving 80 per cent of the total sales. ""So you're not relying on thousands of streams to make 0.003 of a dollar, you'll make 80 per cent of that revenue from us,"" Gillies said. Currently in Australia, artists have to get more than 1000 streams per song a year on Spotify to make any money at all. A total of 1500 including filmmakers and influencers from around the world are already on board. American rapper Ice Cube is a part owner of the platform.

If he released a song on iTunes he'd be lucky to get $150, whereas on MyPremo, he earned $6500 from one song. ""I think it's a really incredible opportunity for artists,"" he said.

Married owners Brett and Maya Horth dedicated the past five years to researching and studying alternative methods to traditional medicine in their pursuit of providing their two children with the best quality of life. Aligning with physicians in the United States, Maya explained they have discovered profound ways to improve health and well-being. “We as a family have struggled with health issues such as fatigue, joint pain, mould issues, Lyme disease, and other concerns - with little improvement from traditional methods,” Maya said. The dynamic duo has found that their Australia-first treatment, The Theta Chamber, is a favourite among clients, who experience instant improvements such as calmness, better emotional regulation, a clearer state of mind, and more.Camera IconThe Theta Chamber at Element.

Credit: Supplied “Theta is the state of relaxation we all know as that drowsy, abstract sensation we feel as we’re falling asleep,” Maya said. “This allows the brain to take the majority of its focus off of sensory perception and conscious thought and to withdraw into the more profound regions of mental activity that we now know as the bio-magnetic field. In this state, ‘reprogramming’ or ‘remapping’ can be achieved.” For more information or to make a booking, visit the website here.

"IPL 2024: &#8216;What RCB have done has been absolutely phenomenal&#8217;, says Sunil Gavaskar",India News Newsdesk,2024-05-22 10:34:29,"New Delhi, May 22 (IANS) Former Indian cricketer Sunil Gavaskar heaped praise on Royal Challengers Bengaluru’s (RCB) performance in the second half of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2024 as “absolutely phenomenal”. After reeling at the bottom of the table in the first half of the tournament, RCB made a sensational comeback as they won their last six matches to finish their league stage campaign in the final four with 14 points. In their first eight games, they only won a single game against Punjab Kings. It’s the fourth time RCB entered the IPL playoffs in the last five seasons. Yash Dayal starred with 2-42, including taking out MS Dhoni in a seven-run final over, as RCB held their nerve to enter the IPL 2024 playoffs with a stunning 27-run win over Chennai Super Kings at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium to play Eliminator on Wednesday against Rajasthan Royals. “What RCB have done has been absolutely phenomenal. Nothing short of phenomenal. Firstly, to believe that they can bounce back takes something special. The leading players there, Faf du Plessis, Virat Kohli, and other senior players, must be the ones most encouraging to the other team members. Other team members can quickly get into a situation where they might feel we’ve lost everything,” said Gavaskar on Star Sports Cricket Live. “It’s up to the seniors, and I think they have done their job. They have done it by showing them how. Faf and Virat have played extraordinary cricket. Rajasthan, on the other hand, have lost their last four or five matches, and they didn’t play well in their last game. So they’ve been out of practice. “Now, unless they do something special like KKR did today, despite not playing for 11 days, it could turn out to be another one-sided game tomorrow. My fear is that it will be another one-sided game where RCB, who are playing just absolutely phenomenal cricket, will walk all over RR,” he added. Rajasthan Royals (RR) finished third in the standings with 17 points and a net run rate of +0.273. They won eight out of their 14 group matches with the last one getting washed out. With a win in the Eliminator, the team can proceed to Qualifier 2, where they will meet the loser of Qualifier 1 for a place in the final. Meanwhile, former England cricketer Kevin Pietersen shared his thoughts on the eliminator match between RCB and RR, said, “RCB is playing cricket as well as they’ve ever played. They’ve got themselves to a situation where momentum is all in their favour. They’ve got bowlers bowling well, batters batting brilliantly, and Faf du Plessis leading them as well as he’s ever led a team. So, I find it very, very hard to think that Rajasthan are going to put up a fight tomorrow.” “They’ve lost Jos Buttler, and Jos Buttler is such a big player. When you open with Yashasvi Jaiswal, and you know that he looks up to Jos so much, it is such a big loss. It’s actually quite sad that the England players have had to leave this tournament and they’re not here on the bigger stage. “I’m sure the players would love to be playing here on the bigger stage in Ahmedabad and then off to Chennai to play the finals. This tournament deserves that, and it’s just unfortunate that some of the biggest players in the world are not going to be here,” Pietersen added. The fight for Qualifier 2 will be tough as RCB, who have the momentum with them after winning six games in a row will face Royals, who are coming after four consecutive loss. –IANS hs/bc",https://indianews.com.au/ipl-2024-what-rcb-have-done-has-been-absolutely-phenomenal-says-sunil-gavaskar/,-0.297,AU
